          <h1>Code of conduct</h1>
          <h2>The Quick Version</h2>
          <p>
            All attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at any ManageOps
            affiliated event are required to agree with the following code of
            conduct.
          </p>

          <p>Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.</p>

          <p>
            We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a
            safe environment for everybody.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
            for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
            age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
            race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.
          </p>

          <p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>

          <p>
            Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any venue,
            including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter, and other online
            media.
          </p>

          <p>
            Event participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or
            expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the
            event organizers.
          </p>

          <h2>The Less Quick Version</h2>
          <p>
            Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
            gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability,
            physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion,
            technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
            intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or
            recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events,
            inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
            Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to
            comply immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
            particular, sponsors should not use sexualized images, activities,
            or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
            sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
            sexualized environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organizers
            may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the
            offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being
            harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of
            event staff immediately.
          </p>

          <p>
            Event staff will be identified by a specific identifier. Event staff
            will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or
            local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
            experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event.
            We value your attendance.
          </p>

          <p>
            We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop
            venues and event-related social events.
